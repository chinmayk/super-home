**Abstract**  Massive online classes are global and diverse. How can we
harness this diversity to improve engagement and learning?
Currently, though enrollments are high, studentsâ€™ interactions
with each other are minimal: most are alone together.
This isolation is particularly disappointing given that a
global community is a major draw of online classes. This
paper illustrates the potential of leveraging geographic
diversity in massive online classes. We connect students
from around the world through small-group video discussions.
Our peer discussion system, Talkabout, has connected
over 5,000 students in fourteen online classes. Three
studies with 2,670 students from two classes found that
globally diverse discussions boost student performance and
engagement: the more geographically diverse the discussion
group, the better the students performed on later quizzes.
Through this work, we challenge the view that online
classes are useful only when in-person classes are unavailable.
Instead, we demonstrate how diverse online classrooms
can create benefits that are largely unavailable in a traditional
classroom.
