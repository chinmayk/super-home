Chinmay Kulkarni is an Assistant Professor of Human Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University, where he directs the Expertise@Scale lab. His work is at the intersection of large-data and automation, learning, and the future of work. In his research, he investigates how the new af-fordances of scale and automation can create new opportunities for people to learn and work more effectively. Typically, this research introduces novel computer systems that demonstrate benefits at large scale that are otherwise not achievable. Research from his group has resulted in systems that have been used by more than 100,000 in 150 countries; and has been adopted by companies such as Coursera and edX. 

Before joining Carnegie Mellon, Chinmay earned a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford Uni-versity, where his thesis won the Arthur P Samuel Award. He has also previously worked at Mi-crosoft Research, and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.
