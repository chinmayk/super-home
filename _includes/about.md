_Assistant Professor, CMU HCII_

**I design computational systems to help people work and learn better, together.**

My research focuses on building technology that uses the networked properties of online communities to improve how people work and learn. Our work combines design techniques, AI models, and research on learning to create learning systems that work at scale. This research has already helped 100,000+ students from 130+ countries learn more effectively in MOOCs, and has advanced the science of learning.
