**The future of learning and work.** I'm interested in the role technology can play in creating the classroom and the workplace of the future.

My research focuses on building technology that uses the networked properties of online communities to improve how people live and learn. Our work combines design techniques, AI models, and research on learning to create learning systems that work at scale. This research has already helped 100,000+ students from 130+ countries learn more effectively in MOOCs, and has advanced the science of learning.
