##Say hi

I'd love to hear from you and meet you. The easiest way to reach me is to **drop by office hours** You don't need to make an appointment for office hours during the school year. If you can't make that time, please [email me](mailto:chinmayk@cs.cmu.edu) and we'll figure something out.

If you are a student at CMU, please read the [FAQ](faq/) for how best to use our meeting.
